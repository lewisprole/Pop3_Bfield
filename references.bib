  abstract = {We have carried out a comparison study of hydrodynamical codes by investigating their performance in modelling interacting multiphase fluids. The two commonly used techniques of grid and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) show striking differences in their ability to model processes that are fundamentally important across many areas of
astrophysics. Whilst Eulerian grid based methods are able to resolve and treat important dynamical instabilities, such as Kelvin-Helmholtz or Rayleigh-Taylor, these processes are poorly or not at all resolved by existing SPH techniques. We show that the reason for this is that SPH, at least in its standard implementation, introduces spurious pressure forces on particles in regions where there are steep density gradients. This results in a boundary gap of the size of an SPH smoothing kernel radius over which interactions are severely damped.},

On both scales, we find that magnetic diffusion can be significantly enhanced by the buildup of strong gradients in magnetic field structure. Large scale nonlinear flows can create compressed cloud layers within which ambipolar diffusion occurs rapidly. However, in the flux-freezing limit that may be applicable to photoionized molecular cloud envelopes, supersonic motions can persist for long times if driven by an externally generated magnetic field that corresponds to a subcritical mass-to-flux ratio. In the case of protostellar accretion, rapid magnetic diffusion (through Ohmic dissipation with additional support from ambipolar diffusion) near the protostar causes dramatic magnetic flux loss. By doing so, it also allows the formation of a centrifugal disk, thereby avoiding the magnetic braking catastrophe.},

At large distances the outflow forms a pair of collimated, antiparallel jets, while close to the disk it is probably driven by gas pressure in a hot, magnetically dominated corona.},

In particular we investigate the role of turbulence, which is thought to ubiquitously accompany the collapse of high-redshift halos. We distinguish between two main cases: the birth of Population III.1 stars\textemdash{}those which form in the pristine halos unaffected by prior star formation\textemdash{}and the formation of Population III.2 stars\textemdash{}those forming in halos where the gas has an increased ionization fraction. We find that turbulent primordial gas is highly susceptible to fragmentation in both cases, even for turbulence in the subsonic regime, i.e., for rms velocity dispersions as low as 20\% of the sound speed. Fragmentation is more vigorous and more widespread in pristine halos compared to pre-ionized ones. If such levels of turbulent motions were indeed present in star-forming minihalos, Population III.1 stars would be on average of somewhat lower mass, and form in larger groups, than Population III.2 stars. We find that fragment masses cover over two orders of magnitude, suggesting that the Population III initial mass function may have been much broader than previously thought. This prompts the need for a large, high-resolution study of the formation of dark matter minihalos that is capable of resolving the turbulent flows in the gas at the moment when the baryons become self-gravitating. This would help to determine the applicability of our results to primordial star formation.},

Previous detections of metals in intergalactic gas clouds, however, find a heavy element enrichment larger than 1/1000 times that of the solar environment, higher than expected for PopIII remnants. In this letter, we report the discovery of a Lyman limit system (LLS) at z = 3.53 with the lowest metallicity seen in gas with discernable metals,
10-3.41{$\pm$}0.26 times the solar value, at a level
expected for PopIII remnants. We make the first relative abundance measurement in such low metallicity gas: the carbon-to-silicon ratio is 10-0.26{$\pm$}0.17 times the solar value. This is consistent with models of gas enrichment by a PopIII star formation event early in the Universe, but also consistent with later, Population II enrichment. The metals in all three components comprising the LLS, which has a velocity width of 400 km s-1, are offset in velocity by \texttildelow{}+6 km s-1 from the bulk of the hydrogen, suggesting
the LLS was enriched by a single event. Relative abundance measurements in this near-pristine regime open a new avenue for testing models of early gas enrichment and metal mixing.},

In this paper we develop and test a new approach to the stabilization of numerical schemes. Our technique can be easily implemented in any existing code since there is no need to modify the solver for the MHD equations. It is based on a modified system in which the divergence constraint is coupled with the conservation laws by introducing a generalized Lagrange multiplier. We suggest a formulation in which the divergence errors are transported to the domain boundaries with the maximal admissible speed and are damped at the same time. This corrected system is hyperbolic and the density, momentum, magnetic induction, and total energy density are still conserved. In comparison to results obtained without correction or with the standard "divergence source terms," our approach seems to yield more robust schemes with significantly smaller divergence errors.},

  abstract = {The cosmic dark ages ended a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, when the first stars began to fill the universe with new light. It has generally been argued that these stars formed in isolation and were extremely massive - perhaps 100 times as massive as the Sun. In a recent study, Clark and collaborators showed that this picture requires revision. They demonstrated that the accretion disks that build up around Population III stars are strongly susceptible to fragmentation and that the first stars should therefore form in clusters rather than in isolation. We here use a series of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations performed with the moving mesh code AREPO to follow up on this proposal and to study the influence of environmental parameters on the level of fragmentation. We model the collapse of five independent minihalos from cosmological initial conditions, through the runaway condensation of their central gas clouds, to the formation of the first protostar, and beyond for a further 1000 years. During this latter accretion phase, we represent the optically thick regions of protostars by sink particles. Gas accumulates rapidly in the circumstellar disk around the first protostar, fragmenting vigorously to produce a small group of protostars. After an initial burst, gravitational instability recurs periodically, forming additional protostars with masses ranging from \textasciitilde{} 0.1 to 10 M\_sun. Although the shape, multiplicity, and normalization of the protostellar mass function depend on the details of the sink-particle algorithm, fragmentation into protostars with diverse masses occurs in all cases, confirming earlier reports of Population III stars forming in clusters. Depending on the efficiency of later accretion and merging, Population III stars may enter the main sequence in clusters and with much more diverse masses than are commonly assumed.},

  abstract = {We investigate the early formation of bound objects with masses comparable to the cosmological Jeans mass (\textasciitilde{}10\^5\^ M\_sun\_). We follow the growth of isolated spherically symmetric density peaks starting from the linear perturbative regime. The initial parameters correspond to density peaks of various widths and heights in a cold dark matter cosmology. We use a one-dimensional spherical Lagrangian hydrodynamics code to follow the dynamical, thermal, and nonequilibrium chemical evolution of the gas. The system includes a collisionless dark matter component and a baryonic component composed of the nine species H, H\^-\^, H\^+\^, He, He\^+\^, He\^++\^, H\_2\_, H\_2\_\^+\^, and e\^-\^. All relevant chemical reactions between these species and their cooling mechanisms are included in the calculations. We explore the dependence of the dynamical evolution of the gas on two parameters: the initial mass scale and the initial overdensity of the system. We follow the evolution of the density, temperature, and abundance profiles within the cloud, assuming two types of central boundary conditions for the collisionless component: in one the infalling dark matter virializes through a reflection from a hard sphere, while in the other it accretes onto a central sink. We find that in both cases, radiative cooling by H\_2\_ affects the collapse dynamics of the gas only after it has already virialized and become part of the bound object. Therefore, radiative cooling is unlikely to have triggered the initial collapse of perturbations at redshifts z {$>$} 10.
Nevertheless, baryonic objects with masses well below the linear theory Jeans mass ({$<\sptilde$}10\^3\^ M\_sun\_) form at high redshifts because of shell crossing by the dark matter. Such objects could be the progenitors of a primordial population of high-mass stars in the intergalactic medium.},

  abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that the first generation of stars may have been quite massive ( 100-300 M{$\Sun$}). Could these stars have left a distinct nucleosynthetic signature? We explore the nucleosynthesis of helium cores in the mass range MHe = 64-133 M{$\Sun$}, corresponding to main-sequence star masses of approximately 140-260 M{$\Sun$}. Above MHe = 133 M{$\Sun$}, without rotation and using current reaction rates, a black hole is formed, and no nucleosynthesis is ejected. For lighter helium core masses, 40-63 M{$\Sun$}, violent pulsations occur, induced by the pair instability and accompanied by supernova-like mass ejection, but the star eventually produces a large iron core in hydrostatic equilibrium. It is likely that this core, too, collapses to a black hole, thus cleanly separating the heavy-element nucleosynthesis of pair instability supernovae from those of other masses, both above and below. Indeed, black hole formation is a likely outcome for all Population III stars with main-sequence masses between about 25 and 140 M{$\Sun$} (MHe = 9-63 M{$\Sun$}) as well as those above 260 M{$\Sun$}. Nucleosynthesis in pair instability supernovae varies greatly with the mass of the helium core. This core determines the maximum temperature reached during the bounce. At the upper range of exploding core masses, a maximum of 57 M{$\Sun$} of 56Ni is produced, making these the most energetic and the brightest thermonuclear explosions in the universe. Integrating over a distribution of masses, we find that pair instability supernovae produce a roughly solar distribution of nuclei having even nuclear charge (Si, S, Ar, etc.) but are remarkably deficient in producing elements with odd nuclear charge\textemdash{}Na, Al, P, V, Mn, etc. This is because there is no stage of stable post-helium burning to set the neutron excess. Also, essentially no elements heavier than zinc are produced owing to a lack of s- and r-processes. The Fe/Si ratio is quite sensitive to whether the upper bound on the initial mass function is over 260 M{$\Sun$} or somewhere between 140 and 260 M{$\Sun$}. When the yields of pair instability supernovae are combined with reasonable estimates of the nucleosynthesis of Population III stars from 12 to 40 M{$\Sun$}, this distinctive pattern of deficient production of odd-Z elements persists. Some possible strategies for testing our predictions are discussed.},

We discuss how metallicity, and a simplified prescription for its effect on mass loss, affects the evolution and final fate of massive stars. We map, as a function of mass and metallicity, where black holes and neutron stars are likely to form and where different types of supernovae are produced. Integrating over an initial mass function, we derive the relative populations as a function of metallicity.

  abstract = {Current and upcoming cosmological observations allow us to probe structures on smaller and smaller scales, entering highly nonlinear regimes. In order to obtain theoretical predictions in these regimes, large cosmological simulations have to be carried out. The promised high accuracy from observations makes the simulation task very demanding: the simulations have to be at least as accurate as the observations. This requirement can only be fulfilled by carrying out an extensive code verification program. The first step of such a program is the comparison of different cosmology codes including gravitational interactions only. In this paper, we extend a recently carried out code comparison project to include five more simulation codes. We restrict our analysis to a small cosmological volume which allows us to investigate properties of halos. For the matter power spectrum and the mass function, the previous results hold, with the codes agreeing at the 10\% level over wide dynamic ranges. We extend our analysis to the comparison of halo profiles and investigate the halo count as a function of local density. We introduce and discuss ParaView as a flexible analysis tool for cosmological simulations, the use of which immensely simplifies the code comparison task.},

In our numerical model, hierarchical formation of dark matter minihalos and Milky-Way-sized halos are followed by a high-resolution cosmological simulation. We model the Pop III formation in H2 cooling minihalos without metal under UV radiation of the Lyman\textendash{}Werner bands. Assuming a Kroupa initial mass function (IMF) from 0.15 to 1.0 M {$\odot$} for low-mass Pop III stars, as a working hypothesis, we try to constrain the theoretical models in reverse by current and future observations. We find that the survivors tend to concentrate on the center of halo and subhalos. We also evaluate the observability of Pop III survivors in the Milky Way and dwarf galaxies, and constraints on the number of Pop III survivors per minihalo. The higher latitude fields require lower sample sizes because of the high number density of stars in the galactic disk, the required sample sizes are comparable in the high- and middle-latitude fields by photometrically selecting low-metallicity stars with optimized narrow-band filters, and the required number of dwarf galaxies to find one Pop III survivor is less than 10 at {$<$}100 kpc for the tip of red giant stars. Provided that available observations have not detected any survivors, the formation models of low-mass Pop III stars with more than 10 stars per minihalo are already excluded. Furthermore, we discuss the way to constrain the IMF of Pop III stars at a high mass range of {$\greaterequivlnt$}10 M {$\odot$}.},

We argue that these HMP stars are second-generation stars formed from gases that were chemically enriched by the first-generation supernovae. The key to this solution is the very unusual abundance patterns of these HMP stars and the similarities and differences between them. We can reproduce these abundance features with core-collapse ``faint'' supernova models that include extensive matter mixing and fallback during explosions.
A computer model of star evolution shows that stars containing very little metal are not a primitive class but instead formed from the debris of older supernovae.

They are presumed to be assembled in the so-called minihalos with virial temperatures of a few thousand K where collapse is triggered by molecular hydrogen cooling. A central question concerns their final masses, and whether fragmentation occurs during their formation. While studies employing Lagrangian codes suggest fragmentation via a self-gravitating disk, recent high-resolution simulations indicated that disk formation is suppressed. Here we report the first high-resolution large-eddy simulations performed with the Eulerian grid-based code Enzo following the evolution beyond the formation of the first peak to investigate the accretion of the central massive clump and potential fragmentation. For a total of three halos, we see that a disk forms around the first clump. The central clump reaches {$\sim$}10 solar masses after 40 yr, while subsequent accretion is expected at a rate of 10\textendash{}2 solar masses per year. In one of these halos, additional clumps form as a result of fragmentation which proceeds at larger scales. We note that subgrid-scale (SGS) turbulence yields relevant contributions to the stability of the protostellar disks. Both with and without the SGS model, the disk evolution appears rather stable during the timescale considered here. We conclude that the first protostar may reach masses up to 40-100 M {$\Sun$}, which are only limited by the effect of radiative feedback.},

A realistic magnetic field of moderate strength has been shown to suppress, through catastrophic magnetic braking, the formation of a rotationally supported disk (RSD) during the protostellar accretion phase of low-mass star formation in the ideal MHD limit. We address, through two-dimensional (axisymmetric) simulations, the question of whether realistic levels of non-ideal effects, computed with a simplified chemical network including dust grains, can weaken the magnetic braking enough to enable an RSD to form. We find that ambipolar diffusion (AD), the dominant non-ideal MHD effect over most of the density range relevant to disk formation, does not enable disk formation, at least in two dimensions. The reason is that AD allows the magnetic flux that would be dragged into the central stellar object in the ideal MHD limit to pile up instead in a small circumstellar region, where the magnetic field strength (and thus the braking efficiency) is greatly enhanced. We also find that, on the scale of tens of AU or more, a realistic level of Ohmic dissipation does not weaken the magnetic braking enough for an RSD to form, either by itself or in combination with AD. The Hall effect, the least explored of these three non-ideal MHD effects, can spin up the material close to the central object to a significant, supersonic rotation speed, even when the core is initially non-rotating, although the spun-up material remains too sub-Keplerian to form an RSD. The problem of catastrophic magnetic braking that prevents disk formation in dense cores magnetized to realistic levels remains unresolved. Possible resolutions of this problem are discussed.},

  abstract = {Jet-driving and fragmentation processes in a collapsing primordial cloud are studied using three-dimensional MHD nested grid simulations. Starting from a rotating magnetized spherical cloud with a number density of nc{$\simeq$} 103 cm-3, we follow the evolution of the cloud until the adiabatic core (or protostar) formation epoch, nc{$\simeq$} 1022 cm-3. We calculate 36 models parameterizing the initial magnetic {$\gamma$}0 and rotational {$\beta$}0 energies. The evolution of collapsing primordial clouds is characterized by the ratio of the initial rotational energy to the magnetic energy, {$\gamma$}0/{$\beta$}0. The Lorentz force significantly affects cloud evolution when {$\gamma$}0 {$>$} {$\beta$}0, while the centrifugal force dominates the Lorentz force when {$\beta$}0 {$>$} {$\gamma$}0. When the cloud rotates rapidly with an angular velocity of {$\Omega$}0 {$>$} 10-17(nc/103 cm -3)2/3 s-1 and {$\beta$}0 {$>$} {$\gamma$}0, fragmentation occurs before protostar formation, but no jet appears after protostar formation. On the other hand, when the initial cloud has a magnetic field of B0 {$>$} 10-9(nc/103 cm -3)2/3 G and {$\gamma$}0 {$>$} {$\beta$}0, a strong jet appears after protostar formation without fragmentation. Our results indicate that Population III protostars frequently show fragmentation and protostellar jets. Population III stars are therefore born as binary or multiple stellar systems; as in present-day star formation, they can drive strong jets that disturb the interstellar medium significantly, and thus they may induce the formation of next-generation stars.},

The high-velocity jet propagates into the low-velocity outflow, forming a nested velocity structure in which a narrow high-velocity flow is enclosed by a wide low-velocity flow. The low-velocity outflow is in a nearly steady state, while the high-velocity jet appears intermittently. The time-variability of the jet is related to the episodic accretion from the disk onto the protostar, which is caused by gravitational instability and magnetic effects such as magnetic braking and magnetorotational instability. Although the high-velocity jet has a large kinetic energy, the mass and momentum of the jet are much smaller than those of the low-velocity outflow. A large fraction of the infalling gas is ejected by the low-velocity outflow. Thus, the low-velocity outflow actually has a more significant effect than the high-velocity jet in the very early phase of the star formation.},

  abstract = {Magnetic fields are usually considered dynamically important in star formation when the dimensionless mass-to-flux ratio is close to, or less than, unity ({$\lambda$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 1). We show that, in disk formation, the requirement is far less stringent. This conclusion is drawn from a set of 2D (axisymmetric) simulations of the collapse of rotating, singular isothermal cores magnetized to different degrees. We find that a weak field corresponding to {$\lambda$} {$\sim$} 100 can begin to disrupt the rotationally supported disk through magnetic braking, by creating regions of rapid, supersonic collapse in the disk. These regions are separated by one or more centrifugal barriers, where the rapid infall is temporarily halted. The number of centrifugal barriers increases with the mass-to-flux ratio {$\lambda$}. When {$\lambda$} {$\greaterequivlnt$} 100, they merge together to form a more or less contiguous, rotationally supported disk. Even though the magnetic field in such a case is extremely weak on the scale of dense cores, it is amplified by collapse and differential rotation, to the extent that its pressure dominates the thermal pressure in both the disk and its surrounding region. For relatively strongly magnetized cores with {$\lambda$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 10, the disk formation is suppressed completely, as found previously. A new feature is that the mass accretion is highly episodic, due to reconnection of the magnetic field lines accumulated near the center. For rotationally supported disks to appear during the protostellar mass accretion phase of star formation in dense cores with realistic field strengths, the powerful magnetic brake must be weakened, perhaps through nonideal MHD effects. Another possibility is to remove, through protostellar winds, the material that acts to brake the disk rotation. We discuss the possibility of observing a generic product of the magnetic braking, an extended circumstellar region that is supported by a combination of toroidal magnetic field and rotation\textemdash{}a ``magnetogyrosphere''\textemdash{}interferometrically.},

We perform hydrodynamical calculations for spherically symmetric clouds, taking into account radiative transfer of the molecular hydrogen lines and the continuum as well as the chemistry of molecular hydrogen. The collapse is found to proceed almost self-similarly, like the Larson-Penston similarity solution. In the course of the collapse, efficient three-body processes transform atomic hydrogen in an inner region of \textasciitilde{}1

However, hydrogen in the outer part remains totally atomic, although there is an intervening transitional layer of several solar masses, where hydrogen is in partially molecular form. No opaque transient core is formed, although clouds become optically thick to H2 collision-induced absorption continuum, since H2 dissociation follows
successively. When the central part of the cloud reaches stellar densities (\textasciitilde{}10-2 g cm-3), a very small hydrostatic core (\textasciitilde{}5 \texttimes{} 10-3 M{$\odot$}) is formed and
subsequently grows in mass as the ambient gas accretes onto it. The mass accretion rate is estimated to be 3.7 \texttimes{} 10-2

core axis length. The fragment mass is given by the thermal Jeans mass
at E=ENL. Given these assumptions and the initial (Gaussian)
distribution of E, we compute the fragment mass distribution as a
function of metallicity. We find that (1) for Z=0, all fragments are
very massive, {$<\sptilde$}103 Msolar, consistent with
previous studies; (2) for Z{$>$}10-6 Zsolar a few

low-mass fragments; (3) the mass fraction in low-mass fragments is

emerges in 0.01solar{$<$}0.1 and (5) for {$>\sptilde$}0.1

Extending prior semianalytic work, we show by direct, high-resolution numerical simulations (of a COBE normalized CDM + {$\Lambda$} model) that reheating will occur in the interval 20 {$>$} z {$>$} 7, followed by reionization and accompanied by a significant increase in the Jeans mass. However, the evolution of the Jeans mass does not significantly affect star formation in dense, self-shielded clumps of gas, which are detached from the thermal evolution of the rest of the universe. On average, the growth of the Jeans mass tracks the growth of the nonlinear mass scale, a result we suspect is due to nonlinear feedback effects. Cooling on molecular hydrogen leads to a burst of star formation prior to reheating, which produces Population III stars with {$\Omega$}* reaching 10-5.5 and {\=Z}/Z{$\Sun$} reaching 10-3.7 by z 14. Star formation subsequently slows down as molecular hydrogen is depleted by photodestruction and the rise of the temperature. At later times, z {$<$} 10, when the characteristic virial temperature of gas clumps reach 104 degrees, star formation increases again as hydrogen line cooling become efficient. Objects containing Population III stars accrete mass with time and, as soon as they reach 104 K virial temperature, engage in renewed star formation and turn into normal Population II objects having an old Population III metal-poor component.},

We base our algorithm on a Markov process on a Voronoi-Delaunay grid, a nonperiodic lattice which is derived from a random point process that is chosen to optimally represent certain properties of the medium through which the transport occurs. Our grid is locally translation and rotation invariant in the mean. We illustrate our approach by means of a particular example, in which the expectation value of the length of a grid line corresponds to the local mean free path. In this example, the lattice is a direct representation of the ``free path space'' of the medium. Subsequently, transport is defined as simply moving particles from one node to the next, interactions taking place at each point. We derive the statistical properties of such lattices, describe the limiting behavior, and show how interactions are incorporated as global coefficients. Two elementary linear transport problems are discussed: that of free ballistic transport, and the transport of particles through a scattering medium. We also mention a combination of these two. We discuss the efficiency of our method, showing that it is much faster than most other methods because the operation count does not scale with the number of sources. We test our method by focusing on the transport of ionizing radiation through a static medium, and show that the computed results for the classical test case of an ionization front expanding in a homogeneous medium agree perfectly with the analytic solution. We finish by illustrating the efficiency and flexibility of our method with the results of a simulation of the reionization of the large scale structure of the Universe.},

Population (Pop) III stars provides a source of initial black hole seeds

follow the growth of over 15 000 black holes born into mini-haloes in
the early Universe. We compute the evolution of the black holes by
post-processing individual remnant Pop III star particles in the
Renaissance simulation snapshots. The black holes populate haloes from
106 up to 109 M\_\{{$\odot\rbrace$}. We find that all of the
black holes display very inefficient growth. On average, the black holes
increase their initial mass by a of factor 10-5, with the
most active black holes increasing their mass by approximately 10 per
cent. Only a single black hole experiences any period of super-Eddington
accretion, but the duration is very short and not repeated. Furthermore,
we find no correlation of black hole accretion with halo mass in the
mass range sampled. Within most haloes, we identify clumps of cool,
dense gas for which accretion rates would be high, but instances of
black holes encountering these clumps are rare and short-lived. Star
formation competes with black hole growth by consuming available gas and
driving down accretion rates through feedback. We conclude that the
black holes born from Popu III remnants do not form a significant
population of intermediate mass black holes in the early Universe and
will need to wait until later times to undergo significant accretion, if

The barotropic relation of primordial gas and artificial stiffening of the equation of state in very dense regions ({$>$}1015 cm-3) enables us to follow the fragmentation of PopIII circumstellar disks and the merging processes of the fragments. The disk becomes gravitationally unstable to fragmentation, followed by a rapid merger process typically within 100 yr, which roughly corresponds to one orbital time of the circumstellar disk. We also find that the fragmentation of the gas disk around a multiple system, a circumbinary disk, is rare; however, it is frequent in the disk around an individual protostar. We also perform a simulation with standard sink particles, where the number and total mass of sink particles are in rough agreement with those of the stiff equation of state runs. Based on the results of these numerical results, we model the evolution of the number of fragments with a simple phenomenological equation. We find that the average number of fragments is roughly proportional to t 0.3, where t is the elapsed time since the formation of the first protostar. Next, we compare this trend with a number of published numerical studies by scaling the elapsed time according to the scale-free nature of the system. As a result, we find most of the results in the literature agree well with the relation. The present results, combined with previous studies in the literature, imply that the PopIII stars tend to be born not as single stars, but in multiple systems.},

  abstract = {The collapse of rotating magnetized molecular cloud cores is studied with axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. Because of the change of the equation of state of the interstellar gas, molecular cloud cores experience several phases during the collapse. In the earliest isothermal runaway collapse (n {$\lessequivlnt$} 1010 H2 cm-3), a pseudodisk is formed, and it continues to contract until an opaque core is formed at the center. In this disk, a number of MHD fast and slow shock pairs appear whose wave fronts are parallel to the disk. We assume that the interstellar gas obeys a polytropic equation of state with the exponent of {$\Gamma$} {$>$} 1 above the critical density at which the core becomes optically thick against the thermal radiation from dusts ncr 1010 cm-3. After the equation of state becomes hard, an adiabatic quasi-static core forms at the center (the first core), which is separated from the isothermal contracting pseudodisk by the accretion shock front facing radially outward. By the effect of the magnetic tension, the angular momentum is transferred from the disk midplane to the surface. The gas with an excess angular momentum near the surface is finally ejected, which explains the molecular bipolar outflow. Two types of outflows are found. When the poloidal magnetic field is strong (its energy is comparable to the thermal one), a U-shaped outflow is formed, in which gas is mainly outflowing through a region whose shape looks like a capital letter U at a finite distance from the rotation axis. The gas is accelerated by the centrifugal force and the magnetic pressure gradient of the toroidal component. The other is a turbulent outflow in which magnetic field lines and velocity fields seem to be randomly oriented. In this case, globally the gas moves out almost perpendicularly from the disk, and the outflow looks like a capital letter I. In this case, although the gas is launched by the centrifugal force, the magnetic force working along the poloidal field lines plays an important role in expanding the outflow. The continuous mass accretion leads to a quasi-static contraction of the first core. A second collapse due to the dissociation of H2 occurs in it. Finally, another less massive quasi-static core is formed by atomic hydrogen (the second core). At the same time, it is found that another outflow is ejected around the second atomic core, which seems to correspond to the optical jets or the fast neutral winds.},

Two test simulations, each with 3 billion particles and 400 million rays in a 50 Mpc h-1 box, have been run to give initial results. Halos are resolved down to virial temperatures of 104 K for the redshift range of interest in order to robustly model star formation and clumping factors. This is essential to correctly account for ionization and recombination processes. We find that the halos and sources are strongly biased with respect to the underlying dark matter, re-enforcing the requirement of large simulation boxes to minimize cosmic variance and to obtain a qualitatively correct picture of reionization. We model the stellar initial mass function (IMF) by following the spatially dependent gas metallicity evolution, and distinguish between the first generation, Population III (PopIII) stars and the second generation, Population II (PopII) stars. The PopIII stars with a top-heavy IMF produce an order of magnitude more ionizing photons at high redshifts z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 10, resulting in a more extended reionization. In our simulations, complete overlap of H II regions occurs at z {$\approx$} 6.5, and the computed mass- and volume-weighted residual H I fractions at 5 {$\lessequivlnt$} z {$\lessequivlnt$} 6.5 are both in good agreement with high-redshift quasar absorption measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The values for the Thomson optical depth are consistent within 1 - {$\sigma$} of the current best-fit value from third-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) results.},

our constrained Hamiltonian formulation is found to provide an effective
means of enforcing the divergence constraint in SPMHD, typically
maintaining average values of h{$\mid\nabla\cdot$}B{$\mid$}/{$\mid$}B{$\mid$} to
0.1-1\%, up to an order of magnitude better than artificial resistivity

code that perturbations arising from discretization of the equations of

collapse of dense molecular cloud cores. In simulation of a
Gaussian-profile cloud free of applied perturbations, we find artificial
fragmentation can be avoided across the isothermal density regime by
ensuring the ratio of cell size to Jeans length, which we call the Jeans
number, J {$\equiv$} {$\Delta$}x/{$\lambda$}J , is kept below 0.25. We
refer to the constraint that {$\lambda$}J be resolved as the
Jeans condition. When an m = 2 perturbation is included, we again find
it necessary to keep J {$<$}= 0.25 to achieve a converged morphology.
Collapse to a filamentary singularity occurs without fragmentation of
the filament, in agreement with the predictions of Inutsuka \&
Miyama. Simulation beyond the time of this singularity requires an
arresting agent to slow the runaway density growth. Physically, the
breakdown of isothermality due to the buildup of opacity acts as this
agent, but many published calculations have instead used artificial
viscosity for this purpose. Because artificial viscosity is resolution
dependent, such calculations produce resolution-dependent results. In
the context of the perturbed Gaussian cloud, we show that use of
artificial viscosity to arrest collapse results in significant violation
of the Jeans condition. We also show that if the applied perturbation is
removed from such a calculation, numerical fluctuations grow to produce
substantial fragments not unlike those found when the perturbation is
included. These findings indicate that calculations that employ
artificial viscosity to halt collapse are susceptible to contamination
by artificial fragmentation. The Jeans condition has important
implications for numerical studies of isothermal self-gravitational
hydrodynamics problems insofar as it is a necessary but not, in general,
sufficient condition for convergence.},

This is less than the relative velocities of baryons and dark matter computed via linear perturbation theory, so we infer that there are supersonic coherent flows of the baryons relative to the underlying potential wells created by the dark matter. As a result, the advection of small-scale perturbations (near the baryonic Jeans scale) by large-scale velocity flows is important for the formation of the first structures. This effect involves a quadratic term in the cosmological perturbation theory equations and hence has not been included in studies based on linear perturbation theory. We show that the relative motion suppresses the abundance of the first bound objects, even if one only investigates dark matter haloes, and leads to qualitative changes in their spatial distribution, such as introducing scale-dependent bias and stochasticity. We further discuss the possible observable implications of this effect for high-redshift galaxy clustering and reionization.},

Numerical simulations of collapsing clouds of primordial gas indicate that the first luminous objects to form in the universe were isolated massive stars. Turk et al. (p. 601, published online 9 July) now show that it is possible for single primordial clouds to break up into two dense cores. Three-dimensional calculations, which follow the evolution of primordial gas (composed of hydrogen and helium, with traces of deuterium and lithium) and dark matter starting from realistic, cosmological initial conditions, suggest that these cores may evolve to form binary star systems.
Previous high-resolution cosmological simulations predicted that the first stars to appear in the early universe were very massive and formed in isolation. Here, we discuss a cosmological simulation in which the central 50 M{$\odot$} (where M{$\odot$} is the mass of the Sun) clump breaks up into two cores having a mass ratio of two to one, with one fragment collapsing to densities of 10-8 grams per cubic centimeter. The second fragment, at a distance of \textasciitilde{}800 astronomical units, is also optically thick to its own cooling radiation from molecular hydrogen lines but is still able to cool via collision-induced emission. The two dense peaks will continue to accrete from the surrounding cold gas reservoir over a period of \textasciitilde{}105 years and will likely form a binary star system.
Simulations show that binary systems are likely to exist among the first generation of stars.

However, in this high Reynolds number regime, real fluids become highly turbulent and turbulent processes mediate substantial transport of momentum and heat that is diffusive in nature. In the absence of models for these processes, code-dependent numerical effects dominate how diffusion operates and may lead to physically incorrect simulation results. We highlight the qualitative difference in these numerical effects for smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and grid-based Eulerian codes using two test problems: a buoyant gas bubble and gas in a galaxy cluster. Grid codes suffer from numerical diffusion in the absence of explicit terms, and small-scale diffusion of heat is completely absent in the Lagrangian SPH method. We find that SPH with heat diffusion added at a level similar to that expected from turbulence diffusion generates more physically appealing results. These results suggest, but do not confirm, that a flat entropy core is to be expected for gas in an idealized galaxy cluster (i.e. one without physics beyond that of a non-radiating gas). A goal of this work is thus to draw attention to the as yet unfulfilled need for models of turbulent diffusive processes in compressible gases in astrophysics.},

We consider 9 different combinations of turbulence and rotation and carry out 5 different realizations of each setup, yielding one of the largest sets of simulations of Population III star formation ever performed. We find that fragmentation in Population III star-forming systems is a highly chaotic process and show that the outcomes of individual realizations of the same initial conditions often vary significantly. However, some general trends are apparent. Increasing the turbulent energy promotes fragmentation, while increasing the rotational energy inhibits fragmentation. Within the 1000 yr period that we simulate, runs including turbulence yield flat protostellar mass functions while purely rotational runs show a more top-heavy distribution. The masses of the individual protostars are distributed over a wide range from a few \$10\^\{-3\} \textbackslash, \{\textbackslash{}rm M\_\{\textbackslash{}odot\}\}\$ to several tens of \$\{\textbackslash{}rm M\_\textbackslash{}odot\}\$. The total mass growth rate of the stellar systems remains high throughout the simulations and depends only weakly on the degree of rotation and turbulence. Mergers between protostars are common, but predictions of the merger fraction are highly sensitive to the criterion used to decide whether two protostars should merge. Previous studies of Population III star formation have often considered only one realization per set of initial conditions. However, our results demonstrate that robust trends can only be reliably identified by considering averages over a larger sample of runs.},

  abstract = {We use cosmological simulations to study the origin of primordial star-forming clouds in a {$\Lambda$}CDM universe, by following the
formation of dark matter halos and the cooling of gas within them. To model the physics of chemically pristine gas, we employ a nonequilibrium treatment of the chemistry of nine species (e-, H,
H+, He, He+, He++, H2, H+2, H-) and include cooling by molecular hydrogen. By considering cosmological volumes, we are able to study the statistical properties of primordial halos, and the high resolution of our simulations enables us to examine these objects in detail. In particular, we explore the hierarchical growth of bound structures forming at redshifts z\textasciitilde{}25-30 with total masses in the range \textasciitilde{}105-106Msolar. We find that when the amount of molecular hydrogen in these objects reaches a critical level, cooling by rotational line emission is efficient, and dense clumps of cold gas form. We identify these ``gas clouds'' as sites for primordial star formation. In our simulations, the threshold for gas cloud
formation by molecular cooling corresponds to a critical halo mass of \textasciitilde{}5\texttimes{}105h-1Msolar, in agreement
with earlier estimates, but with a weak dependence on redshift in the range z{$>$}16. The complex interplay between the gravitational formation of dark halos and the thermodynamic and chemical evolution of the gas clouds compromises analytic estimates of the critical H2 fraction. Dynamical heating from mass accretion and mergers opposes relatively inefficient cooling by molecular hydrogen, delaying the production of star-forming clouds in rapidly growing halos. We also investigate the effect of photodissociating ultraviolet radiation on the formation of primordial gas clouds. We consider two extreme cases, first by including a uniform radiation field in the optically thin limit and second by accounting for the maximum effect of gas self-shielding in virialized regions. For radiation with Lyman-Werner band flux
J{$>$}10-23 ergs s-1 cm-2
Hz-1 sr-1, hydrogen molecules are rapidly
dissociated, rendering gas cooling inefficient. In both the cases we consider, the overall effect can be described by computing an
equilibrium H2 abundance for the radiation flux and defining an effective shielding factor. Based on our numerical results, we develop a semianalytic model of the formation of the first stars and demonstrate how it can be coupled with large N-body simulations to predict the star formation rate in the early universe.},
